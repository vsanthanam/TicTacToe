## Learning Some New Stuff

I started a new job iOS job recently that, in addition to using Swift 4.2 over my usually preffered language of Objective-C, also uses a ton of other libraries & tooling.

This project is an extension of the RIBs tutorial in an attempt to learn some new stuff

## Technologies

* [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org), Apple's long-term replacement for Objective-C 2.0
* [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/ribs), Uber's pattern replacement for MVC to allow for team-scaleable, testable, business-logic-driven mobile apps
* [SnapKit](http://snapkit.io//), DSL for AutoLayout
* [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io), specifically [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), multi-language reactive programming API to reduce dependence on state management
