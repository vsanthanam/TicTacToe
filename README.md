# TicTacToe

## Learning Some New Stuff

I started a new job recently that, in addition to using Swift 4.2 over my usual iOS language of Objective-C, also uses a ton of other libraries & tooling.

This project is an extension of the RIBs tutorial in an attempt to learn some new stuff

## Technologies

* [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org), Apple's long-term replacement for Objective-C 2.0
* [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/ribs), Uber's pattern replacement for MVC to allow for team-scaleable, testable, business-logic-driven mobile apps
* [SnapKit](http://snapkit.io//), DSL for AutoLayout
* [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io), specifically [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), multi-language reactive programming API to reduce dependence on state management

## Setup

1) Clone the repo `https://github.com/vsanthanam/TicTacToe.git`
2) Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) if you haven't already with `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
3) Install the dependencies with `$ pod install`
4) Open the newly generated workspace, `TicTacToe.xcworkspace`
